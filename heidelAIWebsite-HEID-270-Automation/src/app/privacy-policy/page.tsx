            continuously improved based on performance feedback from both automated systems and
            human reviewers. We design our AI systems to be transparent in their operation, allowing users
            to understand the basis for recommendations and automated actions. While our AI can
            significantly enhance efficiency and effectiveness, it is designed to complement human decisionmaking rather than replace it entirely. We believe this balanced approach delivers the best
            results for our customers while maintaining appropriate safeguards against potential issues.

            To improve our AI capabilities, we may use anonymized and aggregated data for training
            purposes. This process helps our systems learn patterns and improve performance over time
            without compromising individual privacy. We do not use customer-specific business data for
            general AI training without explicit permission . We implement robust safeguards to prevent reidentification of individuals in any training data used. Our AI training methodologies are designed
            to continuously improve service quality while maintaining strict privacy protections. The balance
            between effective AI training and data privacy is carefully maintained through both technical
            measures and strict policies governing data usage. Regular audits of our AI training processes
            ensure ongoing compliance with our privacy commitments and applicable regulations.

            using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers to help
            provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing
            their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. We
